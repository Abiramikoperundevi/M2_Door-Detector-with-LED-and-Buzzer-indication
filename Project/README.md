# DOOR DETECTOR WITH LED AND BUZZER INDICATION
A detector is associated with following attributes:
```
 * ATMEGA328
 * VOLTMETER
 * LED
 * SWITCH
 * RESISTOR
 * BUZZER
 * FIXED VOLT
 * AMPMETER
```
### Write seperate functions to perform the following operations:
* Create an Simulation file for detecting the door is opened or not
* Add LED for the indication purpose.
* Here I use switch as the door sensor
* while the switch is open, the LED produce the glow
* And also add Buzzer for the indication purpose
* while the switch is open, the Buzzer produce the beep sound.
* If switch is closed means the LED will not glow and the buzzer does not produce the beep sound.
* I use the voltmeter for the purpose of shown how much of voltage is produce accross the buzzer and LED.
* Ampmeter is connected accross the switch (Fixed Volt) it will show the current value

## Guidelines
* Use Simulide software for simulation purpose and for coding purpose use the visual studio code.
* Return appropriate results from all the functions.
* Follow Modular programming and multifile approach
* Create Makefile with targets for compiling and testing, analysis and coverage.
* Follow best practices while writing the code.
