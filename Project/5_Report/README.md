# Introduction
## Door Detector with LED and Buzzer indication.

Door Detector acts as a security and indication system.It is avilable in the market in two piece form. One piece attaches on the door frame, and the other attaches parallel to the first piece on the door itself. The two parts create a closed circuit when the door is shut. As the door opens, the magnet and switch separate, breaking the circuit. When the circuit breaks, the sensor signals the central control panel and switch on the LED and Beep sound produced by Buzzer.In that it shows the voltage used by the circuit.

## Research:-
Door Detector with LED and Buzzer indication is a mini project which uses microcontroller ATmega328 and work as a indication system. 
 
# Softwares Used
* Visual Studio
* SimulIDE
* Aurdino IDE


## Component Description

### Power Supply:
- External source of power supply that powers all devices, switches and microcontroller

### Microcontroller:
- Performs all operations required by our system. Takes input the signals from the Fixed Voltage and gives output by turning on the LED and BUZZER

### Door Sensor
- A Door detector is a sensor designed to detect while the door is opened or not.

### Voltmeter
- A Voltmeter is and meter used to mesasure the voltage and potential difference bertween the two point and produce the count how much of voltage is used by the buzzer and LED for indication of the door opened or door closed

### LED
- Recieves signals from the switch used as Door Sensor and turn on when Door is Opened

### Buzzer
- Acts as a device to communicate with the user when door is opened

--------------------------------------

## SWOT

### Strengths
- Easy to understand the application and use it
- User friendly gadget
### Weakness 
- Implementation of existing system.
- More costlier gadget for common people

### Opportunities
- Used In Homes,Offices,High Buildings
- Can be used with other indicators also such as speaker.

### Threats
- Other sensors can be used which have greater efficiency.
- Many other similar applications available
